= Hacking with Spring Boot API Portal

When you stand up a web service, people will want to see how to use it. Thanks to Spring REST Docs, you can generate all the interactions needed via test cases that in turn generate readable documentation. A match made in heaven, or at least, in your IDE.

By running the following request:

include::{snippets}/findAll/curl-request.adoc[]

...the `ApiItemController` will yield the following response:

include::{snippets}/findAll/response-body.adoc[]

Fan of HTTPie? You can issue the following command:

include::{snippets}/findAll/httpie-request.adoc[]

...and get the same response. The choice is yours.
